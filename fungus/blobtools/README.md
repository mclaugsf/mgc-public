The following code describes how reads were assembled with megahit, mapped back to the megahit assembly, and then used to generate blobplots https://github.com/DRL/blobtools.

Dockerized nextflow workflows are included that should enable anyone to reproduce these results the same way Medicinal Genomics does.
